# REAL WORLD FUEL EFFICIENCY USING PYTHON
* Sample Dataset Containing Real World fuel efficiency Data of New York of Several leading Premium Car Manufacturing Companies In the Year 2022.
* In this project I have done the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Real World fuel efficiency Data by Using Python (Pandas, plotly, Matplotlib and Seaborn).
